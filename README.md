Hey Vv here!
I am an IT Engineer and a tech-savy guy.

I am more into testing applications rather than developing it. Could test softwares as well as applications.

Due to the background of IT I know basics in HTML, CSS and Python.

Open to any ideas and projects on this open-source platform.

Interested in Infosec!
